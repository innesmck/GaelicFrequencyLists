# Scottish Gaelic Word Frequency Lists

Frequency lists of words and collocations created from learning resources covering a range of subjects on [LearnGaelic](https://learngaelic.scot/).

## What are these?

## What are the different lists?
* [Frequency.csv](https://github.com/innesmck/GaelicFrequencyLists/blob/main/output/combined/frequency.csv) - A list of individual words and a count of how many times they were encountered in the corpus. This can be useful for finding the vocabulary you need to learn to understand enough of the resource to benefit from it, or to make decisions about which new words you encounter to prioritise.
* [Bigrams1.csv](https://github.com/innesmck/GaelicFrequencyLists/blob/main/output/combined/bigrams1.csv) - Pairs of words ordered by how often they appear together in the source text. This can be useful for finding common phrases like "gu bheil" or "'s docha", or which prepositions frequently appear with a verb like "coltach	ri" or "fuireach anns". Excludes definite articles and some single character words, to avoid the list largely being "an cat", "an c√π" etc.
* [Bigrams2.csv](https://github.com/innesmck/GaelicFrequencyLists/blob/main/output/combined/bigrams2.csv) - Pairs of words of four characters or longer, to help find common phrases, or pairs of adjectives and nouns commonly used together.
* [Trigrams.csv](https://github.com/innesmck/GaelicFrequencyLists/blob/main/output/combined/trigrams.csv) - Sets of three words, to help find phrases including articules which needed to be excluded from the bigrams.
